<p>As the 2016 regular season nears, ESPN has ranked this year's Top 100 NFL players starting with Nos. 51-100. The ESPN panel of more than 50 voters comprised of NFL analysts, reporters and statisticians - both from ESPN and outside ESPN - including former players and NFL front-office members rate every player on a scale of 1-100. All players were eligible and each were rated based off how "good they are." A rate of 100 implies "an all-time level of excellence," whereas a 1 is for "a player who doesn't belong in the NFL."</p>
<p><br>The panel placed Seahawks wide receiver Doug Baldwin (No. 90) and linebacker Bobby Wagner (No. 52) on the list of 100-51 top NFL players. The remainder of ESPN's top 100 NFL players list will be released later this week. <br>Read below what the ESPN panel has to say about Baldwin and Wagner:</p>
<p><br>90. Doug Baldwin, WR, Seahawks<br>Avg. rating: 80.71 | 2015 rank: NR<br>A technician from the slot, Baldwin has developed into one of the most efficient wide receivers in the league. Last season, he became the first receiver since at least 1992 -- when targets were first tracked -- to post a 1,000-yard season while catching at least 80 percent of his targets. Baldwin's 14 touchdowns in 2015 were tied for first in the NFL, and he signed a long-term deal with the Seahawks this offseason.</p>
<p><br>52. Bobby Wagner, ILB, Seahawks<br>Avg. rating: 83.67 | 2015 rank: 32<br>A true three-down linebacker, Wagner is great against the run and consistently limits yards after the catch while in coverage. Since 2012, he has piled up 476 tackles, which ranks ninth in the NFL. Wagner is responsible for getting the defense lined up and has emerged as a leader on a unit that has led the league in fewest points allowed for four straight seasons."</p>

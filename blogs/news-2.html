<p>SEATTLE, Wash. — Seattle Seahawks linebacker Bobby Wagner and legend Jacob Green were honored Wednesday evening in front of a hefty crowd at the Paramount Theatre at the 82nd Annual MTRWestern Sports Star of the Year Awards. <br><br>Wagner took the stage and received the Male Sports Star of the Year award, which is given to a male athlete or coach for their outstanding sports achievement in the past year or season. He was nominated for the award alongside Washington athletes such as University of Washington quarterback Jake Browning, Mariners outfielder Nelson Cruz, Washington State wide receiver Gabe Marks and Seattle Sounders FC forward Jordan Morris. <br><br>“I want to thank everybody for this award,” Wagner said during his acceptance speech. “This is a huge honor to receive this award. I’m here with amazing people, amazing athletes.” <br><br>Wagner later added: “It means a lot. It’s just all credit to my coaching staff, to my teammates, to my family and everybody who supported me.”<br><br>Seahawks players have shined in the category the past few years. Wagner is the fourth consecutive player to be awarded the honor following quarterback Russell Wilson (2013), safety Earl Thomas (2014) and defensive end Michael Bennett (2015). It’s fitting for him coming off the best season of his pro career. Wagner broke the Seahawks single-season record for tackles and led the NFL in the statistical category with 167. He also became the first player in franchise history to take the tackle crown, and two weeks ago, the three-time All-Pro attended the Pro Bowl for the third consecutive year. <br><br>“It’s been fun to play for this team, this amazing organization,” Wagner said. “I’m proud to be on the Seahawks, I’m proud to be in Seattle — I love it here.” <br><br>For Green, it was a night of recognition for the outstanding work he has done after football. He was honored as the recipient of the Paul G. Allen Award, which is given to an individual who has made a significant or compelling philanthropic contribution.<br>Green, the Seahawks’ all-time sack leader, has been a fierce commander in the fight against cancer, raising more than $2.6. million for the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and raising more than $420,000 for Komen for the Cure. In 1988, he started his Charity Golf Classic to honor his late father to benefit the center, and this July, it will embark on it’s 30-year celebration. <br><br>“More than anything, I would like to just say that what we do in this community is all about you guys,” Green said during his speech. “There are a lot of people I saw tonight that have given their heart, money and time to help the Jacob Green Charity Golf Classic. It’s not about Jacob Green, it’s about what you guys do, because without you, we couldn’t do what we’ve been doing … there’s a lot of people that helped get me up here tonight.”</p>

    <title>The bromance of Bobby Wagner and Richard Sherman</title>

<p>It’s Pro Bowl time!</p>
<p>OK, so maybe it’s not as exciting as the game that follows, but it’s still entertaining. Is it entertaining in terms of football? No, not really. It’s late in the year, players are banged up and gassed from the season, and there’s nothing on the line. So, as a game, it doesn’t mean much. But, it’s one of the few instances where fun is driving these athletes and not their competitive spirit.</p>
<p>That brings us to the relationship between Richard Sherman and Bobby Wagner. They’re close. A bromance, if you will. It shows during games and on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnBcBzQwRt8">practice field</a>.</p>
<p>Last year’s Pro Bowl had a draft format for Team Michael Irvin and Team Jerry Rice. Wagner and Sherman were on opposite sides of the ball when Sherman was put in for a reverse. <a href="http://www.seahawks.com/news/2016/01/31/bobby-wagner-tackles-richard-sherman-big-loss-pro-bowl-trash-talk-predictably-ensues">The Seahawks’ site has a full rundown here</a>. But, well … it doesn’t go well for Sherman.</p>
<p>It’s back to AFC vs. NFC this year, so there won’t be a Wagner hit on Sherman. But the players have fun so it could be worth the watch.</p>

    <title>Understanding pass game led to evolution of Seahawks linebacker Bobby Wagner</title>

<p> </p>
<p>RENTON, Wash. – Listing all the ways Seattle linebacker Bobby Wagner believes he’s a better player than four years ago when the Seahawks last came across the Atlanta Falcons in the postseason would be lengthy.</p>
<p>At the top of the list would be his improvement as a pass defender.</p>
<p>“There’s a lot of routes that I probably did not see when I was a rookie,” Wagner said this week. “I have more knowledge of the game than I did back then.”</p>
<p>Ask around and you’ll get raves from teammates, opponents and observers about the linebacker Wagner has become heading into Saturday’s NFC playoff game at Atlanta. He led the NFL in tackles during the regular season, was voted to the All-Pro team for the second time in his career, and in the playoff opener against Detroit last week had another 10 tackles to lead Seattle.</p>
<p>Wagner’s always been a stout run defender and an excellent tackler. He’s been steady playing behind a Seattle line that does its job keeping offensive linemen from getting to the second level. But Wagner agrees that his understanding of the passing game is the big reason he’s making enough tackles to lead the NFL. It’s also why he’s grown from being a question mark when he was drafted in the second round in 2012 to one of the premier linebackers in the NFL, a Defensive Player of the Year contender.</p>
<p>“I feel like my route recognition is a lot better,” he said. “It’s not where I want it to be, but it’s a lot better. It has allowed me to get more tackles because my breaks are cleaner because I know where the routes are coming or I know where to expect the ball to be thrown. It’s something I really worked on.”</p>
<p>A lot the knowledge of the air game has come through experience. Not surprisingly, Wagner also turned to a pair of teammates in particular to help improve in those specific areas of understanding pass coverage and recognizing tendencies: cornerback Richard Sherman and fellow linebacker K.J. Wright.</p>
<p>“(Sherman) I feel is the best corner in the league, so if you have the best corner in the league why wouldn’t you ask him for what he sees? And I feel K.J. recognizes routes better than anyone I’ve seen before,” Wagner said.</p>
<p>Sherman’s been one of the top cornerbacks in the NFL for the past five seasons. Wright, while often overlooked because of the rest of the stars on Seattle’s defense, has been a critical part of the Seahawks’ pass coverage since he became a starter as a rookie in 2011.</p>
<p>“We talked a lot on the field about adjustments about splits, about formations,” Sherman said. “He started to see the things that I saw. We would watch film and I would show him the things that I saw and the indicators that I had.”</p>
<p>It’s learning those presnap reads that have allowed Wagner to never sub out. Wagner and Wright have become every-down linebackers who remain on the field even in obvious passing downs. Seattle’s base defense has sometimes morphed from using three linebackers to going with five defensive backs. But even in those circumstances Wagner – and Wright, usually – stay on the field.</p>
<p>“The big thing is the presnap clues as far as anticipation in what is coming and just studying quarterbacks. A lot of quarterbacks are the same and a lot of combinations are the same, so whenever you see someone going out, you know something is coming in,” Wright said. “So just little small stuff that I believe that we both have improved on and has shown up.”</p>

<p>RENTON, Wash. -- Linebacker <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14979/bobby-wagner">Bobby Wagner</a> led the NFL with 167 tackles this season and was the only member of the <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/sea/seattle-seahawks">Seattle Seahawks</a> to be named an All-Pro.</p>
<p>I caught up with him this week for a Q&amp;A in advance of Saturday's divisional round matchup against the <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/atl/atlanta-falcons">Atlanta Falcons</a>.</p>
<p><strong>I was looking at your high school stats. Your junior year, you played tight end and had two catches for 62 yards. Your senior year, that went up to 37 catches, 595 yards and 11 touchdowns. What happened from one year to the next?</strong></p>
<p><strong>BW:</strong> Say it again. He [LB <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16888/kevin-pierre-louis" target="_new">Kevin Pierre-Louis</a> at the next locker over] didn't hear it.</p>
<p><strong>Senior year, you had 37 catches, 11 touchdowns.</strong></p>
<p><strong>BW:</strong> That's a good ratio.</p>
<p><strong>But what happened? How come junior year, you got no play?</strong></p>
<p><strong>BW:</strong> See, junior year, they weren't really utilizing me. The wouldn't give me the rock. No, we had a senior that ended up going to a D-I school that was ahead of me. But as soon as I got my opportunity, I took advantage of it.</p>
<p><strong>So how often do you lobby for a catch here?</strong></p>
<p><strong>BW:</strong> To get a catch? I'm not lobbying. We've got Jimmy [Graham] over there, so I don't want to take anything from him.</p>
<p><strong>You were a good basketball player, too. What NBA player would you compare your game to?</strong></p>
<p><strong>BW:</strong> Honestly, probably LeBron, MJ, Kobe, <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3468/russell-westbrook">Russell Westbrook</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Those are all different types of players.</strong></p>
<p><strong>BW:</strong> If you put them all together, that's who I am [Pierre-Louis shakes his head].</p>
<p><strong>Kevin, is that an accurate assessment?</strong></p>
<p><strong>BW:</strong> It's my Q&amp;A. This is my Q&amp;A. So if you put all those guys together, you'll get me.</p>
<p><strong>Why do you wear No. 54?</strong></p>
<p><strong>BW:</strong> Because 9 is my favorite number. Me and my mother came up with that number when I was younger. So I knew I couldn't wear 9 in the league, so 5 plus 4 equals 9.</p>
<p><strong>You've talked about how massages help you with recovery every week. How important have those been?</strong></p>
<p><strong>BW:</strong> They're really important. I get them [during the week] after the game and then before the game. I do yoga. And I swim and sit in the Epsom salt bath.</p>
<p><strong>When you do yoga, you're going to an actual yoga studio, right?</strong></p>
<p><strong>BW:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>So do people recognize you and bother you?</strong></p>
<p><strong>BW:</strong> Some people don't know me. Some people do. But they're really respectful. Everybody's in there to get a stretch or whatever. They're kind of scared to say 'what's up' so I'll say 'what's up.'</p>
<p><strong>Your linebackers coach told me that you guys will pay for some of the younger guys to get massages. Is that a pay-it-forward type of deal?</strong></p>
<p><strong>BW:</strong> Sometimes we pay for the younger guys when they act right. But when they don't act right [stares at Pierre-Louis], we don't. It really depends on the person. If the person is cool, then we might help them out.</p>
<p><strong>KPL:</strong> You should ask him, what does he require young guys to do when it comes to food?</p>
<p><strong>BW:</strong> I have no shame in it. I feel like I'm a very simple man. I don't ask for much. All I ask for is for them to make me a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. That's it. Just one. Not 70. Just one. It's not your normal peanut butter and jelly sandwich. I may have you cut the left side.</p>
<p><strong>Crust off?</strong></p>
<p><strong>BW:</strong> Just the left side, not the right side, things of that nature. [Stares at Pierre-Louis] It's not like you ever did it.</p>
<p><strong>KPL</strong>: How did I get brought into this? This is your time. Don't worry about me.</p>
<p><strong>BW:</strong> This was your question.</p>
<p><strong>Is that once a week? Or how often?</strong></p>
<p><strong>BW:</strong> It's just one time. Some people never did it.</p>
<p><strong>Crunchy? Creamy? Is there a requirement?</strong></p>
<p><strong>BW:</strong> I don't really like the nuts inside.</p>
<p><strong>KPL:</strong> Why are you looking at me?</p>
<p><strong>BW:</strong> Because this was your question. You told him to ask this question.</p>
<p><strong>OK, who is your most underrated teammate?</strong></p>
<p><strong>BW:</strong> K.J. [Wright]. He doesn't get the recognition that he deserves.</p>
<p><strong>What does he do that the average fan might not pick up on?</strong></p>
<p><strong>BW:</strong> He's really smart, really instinctive. Makes tons of plays. That's the thing, though. Everybody notices it. When you turn on tape or watch on TV, you see 50 come across the screen a lot.</p>
<p><strong>Last one -- what's the weirdest thing Pete Carroll has ever done in a team meeting?</strong></p>
<p><strong>BW:</strong> Threw himself at the whiteboard.</p>
<p><strong>That was the playoffs last year, right? What was your reaction?</strong></p>
<p><strong>BW:</strong> Did he break something? Because he's like a thousand years old.</p>

<p>Prior to each season, Bobby Wagner likes to write down some individual goals, and for a while now, a 150-tackle season has been on that list, as has leading the NFL in that statistical category.</p>
<p>With one game left in the 2016 season, Wagner is already up to 155 tackles, which is an NFL high, 10 ahead of Dallas Cowboys linebacker Sean Lee.</p>
<p>“I’ve written it down several times, this is just the first time I’ve actually gotten it,” Wagner said. “…You write down things in the offseason and you want to go and get them, but when you actually start getting them, you appreciate it. We’ve got one more game, so we’ll see what happens.”</p>
<p>Not only is Wagner’s tackle total the highest in the NFL this season, helping him earn Pro-Bowl honors for the third straight year, it is also the most in a season in Seahawks history, eclipsing Terry Beeson’s mark of 153, which was established in 1978. Wagner wasn’t in a mood to celebrate the record following Saturday’s loss to the Cardinals, but he still appreciates the significance of that record.</p>
<p>“I thought it was a really good accomplishment,” Wagner said. “I thought it was pretty cool. It was unfortunate to get it under those circumstances—I couldn’t really celebrate it like I wanted to—but you really want to appreciate everything. Us being here since 1970-something, it just shows that all the hard work you put into the offseason pays off.”</p>
<p>Wagner has been a key player in Seattle’s defense ever since arriving as a second-round pick in 2012, but he has taken his game to an even higher level this year, making more tackles, improving in pass coverage while also proving to be a very effective blitzer. Wagner’s other written goals in the offseason included improving in pass coverage and becoming more a more vocal leader, all things his teammates and coaches have seen from him this season.</p>
<p>“That’s a fantastic accomplishment, an extraordinary demonstration of consistency over the years too,” Seahawks coach Pete Carroll said of Wagner’s tackle record. “He has really become a great football player and a great leader and he does everything you could hope a guy would do. He had another big game, 10 tackles again and he just does everything.”</p>
<p>Asked what he is doing better this year than before, Wagner had a few theories: “Better position, better breaks, better vision, my drops in coverage are a lot better this year, which helps me on my breaks. I thought I was around the ball a lot before, but I feel like I’m around the ball even more.”</p>
<p>Yet for all Wagner has done this season, what might be the more impressive accomplishment than this year’s numbers is his streak of five straight 100-tackle seasons, a mark of consistency never before achieved by a Seahawk.<br><br>“That shows the consistency of, since you came into the game, you’ve done things consistently,” Wagner said. “That’s more how well you’ve played over a course of time.”</p>

    <title>Bobby Wagner, K.J. Wright spur Seahawks in win</title>

<p>Pete Carroll stopped bouncing on the way to his postgame news conference, doubled back and squeezed through a group of reporters so he could share a moment with the bedrock of his defense.</p>
<p>"Great job, Bobby (Wagner)!" Carroll told his middle linebacker, shaking his head in awe while shaking Wagner's hand. "Such a great, great job!"<br><br>"Appreciate you," Wagner beamed back, like a student who knew he aced the test.<br><br>On a strange, neon green night when Carroll's hip thrusting, griping defensive stars stole the headlines, the 65-year-old coach made sure to cherish the players who don't give him gray hairs. Thursday night's 24-3 victory over the Los Angeles Rams showcased what's different about this NFC West title for the Seahawks, the team's fourth under Carroll. Wagner and his tag team partner K.J. Wright are where it all starts.</p>
<p>The key defensive play Thursday night came in the first quarter. On fourth-and-1 for the Rams inside the 10-yard line, Wagner met 225-pound Los Angeles commercial star Todd Gurley in the hole and pushed Gurley backward. Wright, pursuing the play from behind, came to help his friend and finish the play off. The Rams wouldn't come so close to a touchdown again.<br><br>"They are both the best tacklers I've ever seen in football," cornerback DeShawn Shead said after the game.<br><br>Wagner added seven tackles to his league-leading total Thursday night, with Wright piling up 10 tackles in addition to his usual excellent pass coverage. While Russell Wilson is running out of time to work out the kinks in the Seahawks' offense, the defense lived in the Los Angeles backfield, tallying eight tackles for loss. Wagner and Wright's speed, versatility and smarts have stood out all season for a defense that was once defined by its defensive line and secondary.<br><br>"I definitely think it's our best season together," Wagner said about his year complementing Wright. "We always work off each other. We just feed off each other's energy. We feed off each other's play. When I see K.J. go make a play, I want to go make a play and vice versa. I love watching his film. It's pretty dope."<br><br>Wagner was a second-round pick in 2012, arriving one season after Wright was taken in the fourth-round. Wagner's speed and instincts at middle linebacker stood out immediately and he's still the bigger playmaker of the two. Three of Wagner's plays on Thursday night ended drives, including two quarterback hits on blitzes. (Wagner was sanguine about the plays, wishing Rams rookie Jared Goff held the ball a little longer so he could get sacks.)</p>
<p>Wright had a big tackle for loss and other run stuffs near the line of scrimmage, but his skill set as a weakside linebacker is more subtle.<br><br>He's a product of this era, a hybrid linebacker who can cover tight ends, running backs and wide receivers. Wagner called Wright the "best coverage linebacker in the league" and other teammates lauded Wright's intelligence.<br><br>"K.J. is one of the smartest linebackers I've ever seen," Shead said. "We call him the 'screen master' because he always knows the screen is coming ... he's there before the running back gets the ball sometimes."<br><br>When Wright prevents a screen play before it starts, it often doesn't show up in the box score. But his teammates and coaches know.<br><br>"Bobby has had a great season. ... And K.J. has gone right together, shoulder to shoulder, the whole time. They haven't missed a trick, nothing, all year long. It's been fantastic to see them play in concert with the scheme, the principles, and the intensity, and the focus," Carroll said, emphasizing each word with his own rising intensity. "That's who those guys are. We could not expect guys to play better than those two guys are playing."<br><br>Carroll appreciates his linebackers because they execute his vision at the highest level. After more than five seasons in Carroll's scheme, they have reached that career sweet spot where experience and talent meet. Perhaps more than any of the great players on this historic Seahawks defense, Wagner and Wright are just hitting their career peaks.</p>
<p>"When you look at K.J., just look at his dimensions," defensive end Frank Clark said. "Blockers can't even get on him because of his long arms and his length. When you look at Bobby, he is so fast and quick that he comes in and strikes and finishes. He shows how fast he gets to the ball and makes those tackles. It seems like he averages 15 tackles a game."<br><br>Clark, Shead and Carroll all credited Wagner and Wright's leadership as vital to the Seahawks' defense. Younger teammates teased Wagner for all the media attention he got, while Clark said he was "blessed" to play with two linebackers that are so relentless.<br><br>The lack of drama coming from the linebacker group is noticeable, especially on a night when cornerback Richard Sherman took issue with playcalling and the team's best defensive end, Michael Bennett, was penalized for his celebrations. If Sherman is a high-maintenance talent, Wagner and Wright are low-key professionals.<br><br>Shead said that "winning division titles never gets old," and the locker room was rather jubilant for a team that has done this all before. This is a talented Seahawks team that has lost focus too often this season, but they are in great position to earn a playoff bye at 9-4-1. They are poised to achieve all their goals, and they took time Thursday night to enjoy the moment.<br><br>"This is what we set out to do each year," Wagner said. "To be able to celebrate with my dudes."<br><br>If the Seahawks are to build upon their third NFC title in four seasons, look for Wagner and Wright to be the ones leading the way.</p>

    <title>Wagner back on top thanks to redefining his training regimen</title>

<p>Bobby Wagner does boxing.</p>
<p>He does mixed martial arts.</p>
<p>He does swimming.</p>
<p>He does yoga.</p>
<p>He does massages.</p>
<p>That, he says, is why Bobby Wagner does tackling better than any Seahawk ever has.<br><br>“I feel like I’ve been taking care of my body way better than I’ve taken care of it in the last years. I’ve finally got a routine with massages and yoga and swimming and all these different things that I do. I think that’s helped me not get hurt.”<br><br>That alone has made a huge, record-pace difference.<br><br>Injuries have nagged or sidelined him the previous three years. This season not only has Wagner not missed a game, his missed only one snap on defense. That was Oct. 23 at Arizona, when he and teammates got so dehydrated while playing 95 snaps in the overtime tie they got intravenous fluids during and after the game.<br><br>He and K.J. Wright are Seattle’s unique linebacker duo that is versatile enough to stay on the field even when the Seahawks go to nickel defense with extra backs.<br><br>Wagner is the NFL’s leader in tackles. He has 88 stops in his last seven games. That’s 12.5 tackles per game — more than the rate of 12.2 Chris Spielman sustained in the 1994 season for the Detroit Lions to set the unofficial NFL single-season record for tackles at 195.<br><br>His 16 tackles three weeks ago in the Monday-night win over Buffalo were the most in a game in his five-year career.<br><br>With the Seahawks blitzing him more up the middle this season, the 108 tackles Wagner has through 10 games are already more than he had in his entire 2014 regular season — when he was an All-Pro for the first and only time. He’s well on his way to breaking his career high of 140 tackles as a rookie in 2012.<br><br>He’s on pace for 173 tackles entering Sunday’s game at Tampa Bay (5-5). Terry Beeson owns the Seahawks’ single-season record, 153 tackles in 1978. That was the Seahawks’ third season in existence. That was the also year the NFL began playing a 16-game regular season.<br><br>“He continues to create big plays,” Seahawks coach Pete Carroll said. “He’s making plays in the backfield, really kind of standout hits and tackles to go along with all the numbers that he’s getting. He had three, I think, tackles in the backfield (last weekend in beating Philadelphia). Just great plays and great tackles and highlight hits.”<br><br>Carroll says it’s because of more than just Wagner’s boxing and MMA and swimming and yoga and massages.<br><br>“That’s due to his ability to diagnose plays better than ever. He’s better than he’s ever been. He’s smarter, sharper, more aware of taking advantage of the teaching and game plan and all of that.”<br><br>“You’re just seeing a guy really hitting it right. He’s really on it.”<br><br>And not on a training table as much.<br><br>Last season his ankle bothered him in September. Then as October became November 2015 he played through a pectoral injury.<br><br>In 2014 he finished an October home loss to Dallas with a painful turf toe injury then missed the next five games.<br><br>The year before that he missed a game with an ankle injury and also had a sore knee.<br><br>That 2013 season was the one that opened the league’s eyes to how athletic — and vital — Wagner was to Seattle’s defense. The Seahawks won Super Bowl 48 that season, smashing Denver 43-8 with a defense Wagner anchored with his combination of speed and hitting most middle linebackers don’t have.</p>
<p>Then again, most middle linebackers are bigger than 6 feet and (maybe) 245 pounds.</p>
<p>Attention gained, Wagner became an All-Pro for the 2014 season. He and Carolina’s Luke Kuechly became known as the league’s elite middle linebackers. At the start of training camp for the 2015 season, Seattle rewarded Wagner with a $43 million, four-year contract extension.<br><br>Kuechly kept that status last season as his Panthers reached Super Bowl 50. Wagner got criticized by some for not keeping pace. He played more in pass coverage and had just ½ a sack, his career low. He didn’t get selected as a first-team All-Pro last season, though his 114 tackles were actually 10 more than he had the previous season. Some said his play fell off, that he was no longer elite like Kuechly.<br><br>This summer, NFL Network listed its top 100 players. Wagner wasn’t one of them.<br><br>He lashed back on social media against his haters, and specifically the top-100 snub, with one word: “Disrespect.”<br><br>The chip that has motivated him into each stage of his football life was back.<br><br>Coming out of Colony High School in Ontario, California, he was labeled a mere two-star recruit. The only way he met then-USC coach Pete Carroll was when Carroll was trying to recruit a teammate, not Wagner, to the Trojans. Wagner left home and played for Utah State instead.<br><br>He thought he was the best middle linebacker in college football, and for the 2012 draft should have been a first-round pick. But largely, he feels, because he was from Utah State he didn’t get drafted until the second round — by Carroll and the Seahawks. Wagner joked after the draft Carroll said he remembered him from high school. And that Carroll recalled Wagner was “about 5 feet 4” at the time.<br><br>So when the critics said he regressed last season off his All-Pro level, Wagner had a familiar, slighted feeling.<br><br>“There were a lot of things that I was tired of hearing, whether it was that, whether it was what media people even in this area were saying,” he said. “So I was just tired of having my name get followed by some disrespect.<br><br>Wagner first began boxing training when Ken Norton Jr. — son of the 1970s heavyweight champion and ex-Marine that once broke Muhammed Ali’s jaw in a bout — was Wagner’s linebackers coach with the Seahawks.<br><br>When Norton left before last season to become the defensive coordinator for the Oakland Raiders, Wagner stopped training in boxing. But this past offseason he was working out in Los Angeles near where he grew up in Ontario, California.<br><br>“I found a little boxing gym,” Wagner said. “And I found a little boxing gym here in Seattle, in Bellevue, and I just started doing it again.”<br><br>How does the work in the boxing gym translate to Wagner’s day job with the Seahawks?<br><br>“Quickness,” he said, well, quickly.<br><br>“Quick hands and endurance and the jump rope and all that stuff (for) the footwork. Everything is precision. Everything is focus. So that kind of focus carries on and makes me focus a little bit more on the field.<br><br>“There’s also some MMA stuff, so hand placement and hand work. That’s probably helped me in my blitzing.”<br><br>Wagner isn’t doing any sparring in the ring. The Seahawks wouldn’t exactly be thrilled with him trading head shots and body blows in the name of quickness.<br><br>“No, I’m not there with Floyd (Mayweather) and them. Yet,” he joked. “Just give me a couple more years.”<br><br>Wagner also swims. Regularly. He gets in the pool most Tuesdays, the usual off day for players in the NFL week. And that’s where he will be Friday afternoon, just before the Seahawks’ 5½ hour flight to Tampa, Florida.<br><br>“It’s very relaxing,” he said. “I try to incorporate on my off days, or Fridays before we leave on the plane. I just go for a swim.”<br><br>Hey, whatever works. Wagner’s back on top again. Not just on defense for the Seahawks on top of the NFC West.<br><br>On top of the entire NFL.<br><br>“Just trying to prove everybody wrong again,” Wagner said.<br><br>“Just like I normally do in life.”</p>

    <title>Bobby Wagner Again Plays “Lights Out” in Seahawks Win Over Philadelphia</title>
    <author>

      <![CDATA[<p><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1025/1035/files/rm2_1212_large.jpg?v=1479748664" alt=""></p>
<p>Picking an MVP of a Seahawks defense is never easy if only because there are so many talented playmakers on Seattle’s roster, but you’re probably not going to get any arguments within the Seahawks locker room these days if you want to make a case for middle linebacker Bobby Wagner.</p>
<p>Wagner has been phenomenal all season for the Seahawks, and he was at it again in Sunday’s 26-15 win over the Philadelphia Eagles, piling up 15 tackles and one sack, giving him a league-best 108 tackles this season, including 78 in his past six games. With six games still left this season, Wagner has a very good shot at breaking linebacker Terry Beeson’s team record of 153 tackles, set in 1978. Wagner also became the first player in franchise history to record 100-plus tackles in five straight seasons, and he now has 586 in his career since coming to Seattle as a second-round pick in 2012.</p>
<p>“He’s killing it, man,” defensive end Cliff Avril said. “He’s killing it. B-Wags is playing lights out right now. It’s tremendous to have that many tackles at this point in the season. The sky’s the limit for him. He’s been playing lights out, playing fast, being vocal, being a leader. He’s just a heck of a ball-player.”<br>Wagner has been outstanding throughout his career, including when he earned first-team All-Pro honors and one MVP vote in 2014, but this might be the best he has ever played.</p>
<p>“I’d be lying right now if I said I didn’t think this was (my best season),” Wagner said. “The focus is there, I feel like the D-line is doing a great job of keeping guys off of me. K.J. (Wright) and I are doing a great job getting in the film room and studying and just kind of seeing plays. I just feel like we’re in a groove. K.J. and I are kind of just growing up out there together. It’s cool to play football with your brother, basically.”<br>As Wagner points out, his growth goes hand in hand with that of weakside linebacker K.J. Wright, who added 10 tackles Sunday, giving him 87 this season, second on the team behind Wagner.</p>
<p>“(Wagner) is just playing great ball,” Seahawks coach Pete Carroll said. “He and K.J. are playing great. They’re just playing top-line, as good as you can do it in football. I thought the effort on defense was really good all day long.”</p>
<p>Adding to Wagner’s impressive season has been his increased role as a pass-rusher with defensive coordinator Kris Richard calling his number more on blitzes than in the past. Wagner has 2.5 sacks this season, but he has been affecting quarterbacks more than that number would indicate, as is evident in his 13 quarterback hits, a total that is tied for third on the team with Michael Bennett, trailing only Avril and Frank Clark.<br>“I’m having a lot of fun getting in that backfield,” Wagner said. “It has been a blessing, man. The blitzes have been perfectly timed, so I’m grateful, hopefully coach Richard keeps calling them.”</p>
<p>Wagner’s plays were just part of another strong effort for the entire defense, which is now back to leading the NFL in scoring defense (17.3 points per game), a stat in which the Seahawks have ranked No. 1 for four straight seasons. With Kam Chancellor returning from injury last week, and with Bennett expected back soon from a knee injury, Seattle’s defense is confident that things will only get better going forward.</p>
<p>“I really feel like we still have another level to reach,” Wagner said. “We’re starting to get the turnovers, they’re starting to come. We’re playing well, but there’s some key guys missing who will really add to our team.”</p>

    <title>Seahawks Avenge Super Bowl Loss to Patriots</title>

<p>With a Super Bowl XLIX rematch on the line, and the roles reversed this time around, it was the Seattle Seahawks who stopped the New England Patriots at the goal line to win it.<br><br>Four times the Patriots (7-2) tried to get in the end zone from inside the 2 as the clocked ticked closer and closer to 0:00, and four times the Seahawks (6-2-1) didn’t let it happen, earning them a 31-24 victory.<br><br>After three straight rush attempts to bull their way into the end zone failed, Tom Brady couldn’t connect with Rob Gronkowski on a fade route on fourth down, which was evocative of the final seconds of the Super Bowl two seasons ago when Malcolm Butler picked off a Russell Wilson pass on the goal line to win the title for the Patriots.<br><br>Wilson and Doug Baldwin were the stars of the night, helping the ailing Seahawks offense to finally find its rhythm. Wilson completed 25-of-37 passes for 348 yards and three touchdowns, all three of which were brought in by Baldwin. <br><br>Defensively, the Seahawks held the Patriots to its lowest scoring total since Brady returned from suspension in Week 5. DeShawn Shead forced Brady’s first interception of the season, and Kam Chancellor stripped Julian Edelman for another rare Patriots turnover, which led to a Seahawks touchdown that gave them the 31-24 lead.<br><br>The Seahawks currently sit atop the NFC West and hold the No. 2 seed in the NFC playoffs. Seattle’s quest for the coveted playoff bye continues with the Philadelphia Eagles, who are coming off a huge upset against Atlanta.</p>]]>

    <title>Seahawks Victory at New England a “Really Cool Night of Football&quot;</title>

<p>The Seahawks don’t believe in statement wins. They’re not a team that’s going to approach any game as a “big game” or a “must-win” or any other label you might want to throw on a matchup like Sunday night’s against the New England Patriots.</p>
<p>But none of that means the Seahawks can’t appreciate what they accomplished after the fact, especially when that accomplishment is a 31-24 road victory over a Patriots team that was coming off of its bye, while Seattle had a short week, having played on Monday night in Week 9.</p>
<p><br>“It was a really cool night of football,” Seahawks coach Pete Carroll said. “It’s because we respect them so much is really why I say that.”<br>The Seahawks improved to 6-2-1 with the victory and handed New England just its second defeat of the season and its first since Tom Brady returned from suspension.<br>“This was a really good win today because of who we just played and the kind of club this is,” Carroll said. “The coaching staff, the players, the history, the season that they’re having, we have great respect for them, so it’s a really good accomplishment for our guys."</p>
<p><br>“We played the best team you can put out there. It’s a great football team. They’ve got everything going for them. They have the best quarterback who’s ever played, the best coach who’s ever coached, and it can’t get any better that that. It made a nice little night against all that… What’s most important for us is that we didn’t play differently for this opponent. We don’t do that. We play exactly the same way we always play with the same expectations, same approach, then when it’s over, now you can look back and say, ‘That was a hell of a football team that you played.’ It just gives you that little bit in the back of your mind, you feel a little bit better about what you can do and what you’re capable of, and in that it makes you stronger.”</p>
<p>And it wasn’t just that the Seahawks earned an important and impressive victory in New England, they also did so by winning what was about as entertaining and dramatic of a regular-season game you could ask for. The two teams traded leads seven times, with the Seahawks answering every one of New England’s scoring drives with a score of their own. Brady and Russell Wilson traded perfect throws into tight coverage that showed why they’re two of the game’s best quarterbacks, both defenses made big plays, then in a moment fitting for two teams that last faced off in Super Bowl XLIX, the game came down to a final goal-line stand, but this time it was the Seahawks getting the stop to win the game.</p>
<p><br>“They got their plays, we made our plays, back and forth, and we finished,” said cornerback DeShawn Shead, who had the first interception of a New England quarterback this season. “We finish, that’s the key. Our definition of finishing is ‘do right longer’ and it went all the way down to the last second, and we finished.”<br>Receiver Doug Baldwin added, “It was kind of ironic that the ball was on the 1-yard line with an opportunity to win it, but fortunately enough, the ball rolled our way this time.”</p>
<p><br>Even if the Seahawks had plenty working against them heading into the game—cross country trip on a short week to face New England off a bye, one of their best defensive players, Michael Bennett, out with a knee injury, etc.—this result shouldn’t come as too big of a surprise to anyone who has watched the Seahawks under Carroll. The Seahawks are now an NFL-best 29-6 in November and December dating back to the 2012 season, and just as they did in 2014 and again last year, it looks like the Seahawks are once again starting to hit their stride in the second half of the season.<br>“This is what we’ve been talking about, trying to take this turn right here,” Carroll said. “… I’m so fired up about these guys, and have been throughout the entire offseason and continue to be. The resolve that they have and focus and leadership that we have allows us to be in moments like this and come through and do things like this. It takes experience and guts and grit and all the good stuff. We’ve got the right kind of guys to do stuff like this.”</p>
<p><br>Added safety Earl Thomas, “We know who we are, we understand that we’re a good football team. We just beat a great team on the road, a great quarterback. We’ve just got to keep going… In the NFL, it’s so hard to win, man. Every game is like this, it seems like, but the good thing about it is we bowed up at the end.”</p>
<p>In particular, the Seahawks appear to really be getting on track on the offensive side of the ball. While the defense has for the most part been great all year other than a few bumps in the road, the offense has had some rough patches, in no small part due to injuries to Wilson and a few other key players. With Wilson getting healthier, the offense was able to take a pretty big step forward in last week’s win over Buffalo, then play even better in New England, gaining a season-high 420 yards while scoring on seven of their nine possessions before running out the clock on their 10th.</p>
<p><br>“We had to kick it into gear a week ago,” Carroll said. “We had been waiting just to get healthy. Maybe we waited a couple weeks too long, but we were waiting on Russ to be right. We kicked it in last week. You saw the change, (offensive coordinator Darrell Bevell and offensive line coach Tom Cable) and all the offensive coaches seized the opportunity to go ahead and go… It’s there for us now. We have a chance to really grow and be a little bit better, so we’re trying to get a little bit better each week.”</p>
<p>Seattle’s “kicked into gear” offense added more balance than it has shown for most of this season, picking up 96 yards on the ground, including 66 from rookie C.J. Prosise in his first start, but what is really evident is that Wilson and the passing game are starting to find the high level of play they finished last season with when Wilson ended up leading the NFL in passer rating and Baldwin led the league in touchdowns. Wilson completed 25 of 37 passes for 348 yards, three touchdowns and no interceptions, giving him a 124.6 passer rating, and Baldwin was on the receiving end of all three of those touchdowns.</p>
<p><br>“We’re able to do it, we are capable of doing it,” Baldwin said. “We’ve shown it in the past… We have so many weapons, then you’ve got an elusive, athletic freak of nature quarterback who can get the ball to those weapons, so to us, it was just, unleash the dragon, let us go. That was pretty much it.”<br>There’s still plenty of work to be done for the Seahawks, but playing one of the NFL’s best teams on the road, they showed Sunday night that they once again appear poised to finish a season strong.</p>
<p><br>“We’re just starting to hit our stride,” linebacker Bobby Wagner said. “We always want to hit our stride towards the end of the season, and we feel like we’re doing that.”</p>

<p>Jimmy Graham’s two touchdown catches paved the way to a 31-25 Seahawks win over the Buffalo Bills on Sunday in Seattle.</p>
<p>Graham needed only one hand to catch a pair of first-half touchdown passes from quarterback Russell Wilson. Coming off a serious, season-ending knee injury last season, Graham has struggled with consistency in 2016. That wasn’t the case Monday, as he caught all eight of his targets for 103 yards, his third time reaching the 100-yard mark this season.</p>
<p><span>The Seahawks (5-2-1) had to hold off a Bills rally in the closing seconds of the game. Quarterback Tyrod Taylor led Buffalo (4-5) down to the Seattle eight-yard line, but back-to-back throws into the end zone on third and fourth downs fell incomplete, and Seattle pulled off its 11</span><span>th</span><span> straight Monday night victory.</span></p>
<p>After trading scores the entire first half, Richard Sherman intercepted Taylor in the end zone in the opening drive of the third quarter, which set the tone for a defensive second half. No points were added to the board in the third quarter, and Seattle entered the fourth with a 28-17 lead.</p>
<p>A late Mike Gillislee touchdown from one-yard out, and ensuing two-point conversion run by Taylor, brought Buffalo to a three-point deficit with 6:49 remaining. Wilson responded by driving down the field to add three points to the lead, and Seattle’s stout red zone defense sealed the victory.</p>
<p>With Seattle’s run defense was non-existent Monday, Wilson carried the offensive workload. The quarterback completed 20-of-26 passes for 282 yards and two touchdowns, while adding a three-yard touchdown on the ground.</p>
<p>With the Arizona Cardinals on a bye week, the Seahawks now hold a two-game lead in the NFC West.</p>
<p>Next week, the Seahawks head to New England to play the AFC-leading Patriots on Sunday night.</p>]]>

    <title>Seahawks Linebacker Bobby Wagner Leaps Over Line, Blocks Cardinals Field Goal</title>

      <![CDATA[<p> <img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1025/1035/files/636128682667038109-XXX-96V1412-86213920.JPG?v=1477348692" alt=""></p>
<p> </p>
<p>GLENDALE, Ariz. — In film study leading up to the Seahawks’ matchup with the NFC West rival Cardinals in Arizona, Bobby Wagner saw something that would end up helping his team out tremendously on Sunday Night Football.</p>
<p>As Arizona lined up for a 39-yard field goal early in the second quarter of the Week 7 game at University of Phoenix Stadium, the Seattle middle linebacker put his good study habits to use. Moments before the Cardinals snapped the football, Wagner sprinted toward the line of scrimmage and leapt over the crouched body of Aaron Brewer, clearing the 6-foot-5, 232-pound Arizona player as he snapped the football. Wagner landed safely on the other side and extended both arms in the air to block the oncoming boot from Chandler Catanzaro. Wagner recovered the football, too, and more importantly kept a game that to that point had been a defensive battle locked in a 0-0 tie.</p>
<p>“I just saw him really low,” Wagner said from Seattle’s locker room postgame following the 6-6 tie, the team’s first draw in franchise history. "Something we’ve seen on film that he was really low and I felt like I could jump over him, so I tried it and it was a success.”</p>
<p>Despite seeing an opportunity on film, Wagner, who finished with a game-high 13 tackles (12 solo), said he didn’t practice the play this past week. He did, however, used to jump over people “when I was little.” <br>“I’ve been trying to tell you guys I was a basketball player first,” he said. “So I knew I could do it. Just waiting for my opportunity.”</p>
<p>Wagner’s remarkable play was reminiscent of what strong safety Kam Chancellor did on two consecutive occasions in January 2015 during a divisional round playoff game against the Carolina Panthers. Chancellor, though, didn’t come up with the block. Instead, Chancellor was flagged for running into the kicker. So whose field goal-leap was better?</p>
<p>Wagner’s field goal block was a standout in a series of “incredible special teams plays,” as Seattle head coach Pete Carroll put it.</p>
<p>Seahawks rookie receiver Tanner McEvoy blocked a fourth-quarter Cardinals punt that linebacker Cassius Marsh recovered to help Seattle get on the scoreboard, as four plays later kicker Steven Hauschka booted a 40-yard field goal to tie the game at 3-3. And in a game that saw both offenses struggle to move the football throughout, Jon Ryan punted nine times, which gave way to solid punt coverage from players like Neiko Thorpe and DeAndre Elliott.</p>
<p>"We’re big on special teams here,” said Elliott. “So I’m just doing whatever they ask me to do."</p>
<p>Added McEvoy: “We always talk about how big special teams are. That’s kind of our mentality to it.”</p>

<p>You don’t have “Win Forever” as one of your core philosophies and stand totally happy with a 3-1 record in the first quarter of the season.But given where things were after Week 2 — one win, one touchdown scored, one banged-up quarterback — and 3-1 doesn’t sound so bad.</p>
<p><br>“We’re excited about turning the corner and going to the second quarter,” Carroll said after Sunday’s 27-17 win over the New York Jets. “We’re ready to do this.”<br><br>The Seahawks will wait a week, though, taking Sunday off for their bye.</p>
<p>MLB Bobby Wagner. There are no shortage of deserving candidates. But you can give Wagner as much credit as anyone for the way the front seven has played so far, especially against the run, holding opponents to 3.3 yards per carry and making the likes of Todd Gurley and Matt Forte almost non-factors. “He’s just on it,” Carroll said this week. “He calls all the signals, makes all the calls up front.”</p>

    <title>Seahawks Cornerback Richard Sherman And Linebacker Bobby Wagner Preview Sunday&apos;s Game at Los Angeles Rams</title>

<p>Two players with southern California ties, cornerback Richard Sherman and linebacker Bobby Wagner<span>,</span> spoke with the press on Wednesday at Seahawks headquarters ahead of the team's Week 2 matchup with the Rams in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Here's what we learned from Sherman, a Compton native, and Wagner, an Ontario product, about facing Seattle's NFC West foe this Sunday at L.A. Memorial Coliseum. </p>
<h2><span>1. The Rams "Can Go Out There And Change Everybody's Mind"</span></h2>
<p>Los Angeles' 28-0 loss in the season-opener against the San Francisco 49ers this past Monday night wasn't the type of performance Seahawks players have come to know, and expect, from the Rams. Sherman said he wouldn't be surprised to see a hungrier group take the field looking to rebound against Seattle.</p>
<div id="ad-manager-ad-ad-default-300x250-mob-tab-top-0" class="ad-manager-ad gpt-ads">
<div id="ad-manager-ad-ad-default-300x250-mob-tab-top-0-960">     <a href="https://www.bobbywagner54.com/collections/all">Check out my NEW gear!</a>
</div>
<div></div>
</div>
<p>“It’s the NFL, any given Sunday," said Sherman. "They’re pros, they can go out there and change everybody’s mind. That’s the thing about professional sports in anything. That’s why you play the game, it’s because anything can happen on any given Sunday.”</p>
<p>Wagner, meanwhile, was asked about the success Los Angeles has had in recent seasons against the Seahawks, with the Rams winning both games against Seattle last year. </p>
<p>“I think people look at the Seahawks and want to play their best, and they’re no exception," said Wagner. "When they see us come to play, they’re going to play their best. Even though you watched them last game and they struggled, we don’t expect them to do that this time."</p>
<h2><span>2. "It's Really Important" To Stop Todd Gurley</span></h2>
<p>One key to success for the Seahawks against the Rams will be in limiting the amount of damage done by running back Todd Gurley, the NFL's 2015 Offenisve Rookie of the Year. Gurley missed the 2015 regular-season opener against Seattle because of an injury, but he carried 19 times for 83 yards and a touchdown in the Rams' Week 16 win over the Seahawks. His 17 touches racked up just 47 yards (2.8-yard average) in the season-opener earlier this week against the Niners, and Wagner knows if Seattle can find that type of success against Gurley it will go a long way in curbing Los Angeles' offense.</p>
<p>“It’s really important," Wagner said of stopping Gurley. "If you watch the last game, you know that once you can slow him down they really couldn’t do much. It kind of became predictable as far as passing situations and stuff like that. We understand he’s a guy that they want to get the ball, whether it’s in a run, screen, stuff like that. We definitely have to know where he’s at on the field, but it’s a challenge that I think we’re looking forward to.”</p>
<h2><span>3. Pete Carroll Will "More Than Likely" End Up On Top Of A Locker</span></h2>
<p>One challenge that Sherman and the Seahawks aren't looking forward to, however, is calling the L.A. Coliseum's locker room home for four quarters. Sherman, who played his college ball at Stanford, is all too familiar with the setting from the games he played against the USC Trojans.</p>
<p>"It’s a closet," Sherman said. "It’s a closet and you can’t ever see anybody. It’s rows and rows and rows of lockers separated. You can’t see the coach from any one spot. They just kind of have to yell throughout the whole locker room. That is a rough locker room. That’s one part I didn’t think about. I don’t look forward to going back in that.”</p>
<p>Sherman said he wouldn't be surprised to see Seattle head coach Pete Carroll stand on top of the lockers - like he did against the Baltimore Ravens last season - in order to see and address his players.</p>
<p>“More than likely," Sherman said. "More than likely he’s probably going to end up back on lockers screaming. But that’s less about the locker room space and more about how crazy he is.”</p>

    <title>Monday Round Up: ESPN Ranks Doug Baldwin, Bobby Wagner in Top 100 Players, Nos. 100-51</title>

<p>As the 2016 regular season nears, ESPN has ranked this year's Top 100 NFL players starting with Nos. 51-100. The ESPN panel of more than 50 voters comprised of NFL analysts, reporters and statisticians - both from ESPN and outside ESPN - including former players and NFL front-office members rate every player on a scale of 1-100. All players were eligible and each were rated based off how "good they are." A rate of 100 implies "an all-time level of excellence," whereas a 1 is for "a player who doesn't belong in the NFL."</p>
<p><br>The panel placed Seahawks wide receiver Doug Baldwin (No. 90) and linebacker Bobby Wagner (No. 52) on the list of 100-51 top NFL players. The remainder of ESPN's top 100 NFL players list will be released later this week. <br>Read below what the ESPN panel has to say about Baldwin and Wagner:</p>
<p><br>90. Doug Baldwin, WR, Seahawks<br>Avg. rating: 80.71 | 2015 rank: NR<br>A technician from the slot, Baldwin has developed into one of the most efficient wide receivers in the league. Last season, he became the first receiver since at least 1992 -- when targets were first tracked -- to post a 1,000-yard season while catching at least 80 percent of his targets. Baldwin's 14 touchdowns in 2015 were tied for first in the NFL, and he signed a long-term deal with the Seahawks this offseason.</p>
<p><br>52. Bobby Wagner, ILB, Seahawks<br>Avg. rating: 83.67 | 2015 rank: 32<br>A true three-down linebacker, Wagner is great against the run and consistently limits yards after the catch while in coverage. Since 2012, he has piled up 476 tackles, which ranks ninth in the NFL. Wagner is responsible for getting the defense lined up and has emerged as a leader on a unit that has led the league in fewest points allowed for four straight seasons."</p>

<p>Bobby Wagner is only 25, but with four years of NFL experience, the All-Pro linebacker getting looked at as one of the leaders on the Seahawks’ defense. How does he feel about it?<br><br>“Being an older guy is kind of interesting,” he told 710 ESPN Seattle’s John Clayton on Wednesday. “I don’t feel old.”</p>
<p>That’s not to say he doesn’t feel comfortable in the role, though. After all, he said, he had good mentors as a rookie himself in players like Red Bryant and Brandon Mebane.<br><br>“I’m saying to the young guys, just come in and ask questions. When I got here, Bane talked to me every day,” Wagner said.<br><br>As for what he tells them: “You’re not the big guy in town anymore. You’re the guy who needs to ask questions, find out what Seahawk football is all about and really just make your way into this league. You gotta earn respect before it’s given to you.”<br><br>Wagner is far from the only player in a similar situation for the Seahawks, and that’s working to their advantage.<br><br>“We have a lot of guys maturing and a lot of guys are kind of at their peak right now. … I feel like our depth is really, really good,” he said.<br><br>“I feel like it’s kind of an interesting year because when I got here a lot of the team was super young and still trying to learn, but you can see now the growth from everybody. Everybody’s been in the league a little bit longer, everybody’s starting to mature and understand the defense, and we’re starting to talk more about things that we probably didn’t even talk about when we first got here. It’s an exciting feeling to be out there with a bunch of guys who have been there for a really, really long time because we’re fortunate to do that. Not a lot of teams get to do that.”</p>

    <title>&apos;Celebrity Coach&apos; Bobby Wagner Supports Seattle Rotary Basketball Fundraiser</title>

      <![CDATA[<p><img class="img-responsive" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1025/1035/files/bobbywagner_large.jpg?10471647742427642597" alt=""></p>
<p>Bobby Wagner was in the middle of coaching one of the top youth basketball teams in the Pacific Northwest this past Saturday, but at halftime, the Seattle Rotary Style (Blue) 3rd grade squad looked far from what Wagner knew they were capable of.</p>
<p>"The first half they were playing decent, but they weren’t playing like the way they could be playing," Wagner said of this past weekend's 'Battle of the Best in the Pacific Northwest' fundraising event held at Cleveland High School that saw Seattle Rotary face off against MVP Basketball Club of Portland. "They weren’t playing like they were the No. 1 team in Seattle."</p>
<p><img class="img-responsive" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1025/1035/files/Screen_Shot_2016-05-25_at_3.14.00_PM_large.png?6984277072915170902" alt=""></p>
<p>So Wagner, who was serving as a celebrity coach for the event along with fellow Seahawks linebacker K.J. Wright, a guest coach for the Portland side, resorted to a bit of bribery in an effort to get his team to play up to par. The crowd on hand at Cleveland High had just been treated to a Chick-Fil-A giveaway that had the kids on the court wondering, "Do we get Chick-Fil-A, too?"</p>
<p>"Probably the funniest moment of the event," Wagner recalled. "... I was like, 'Well, if y'all play how y’all supposed to be playing and have some energy, I'll give y’all some Chick-Fil-A.’ So they started playing way better for the chicken. They ended up blowing the team out.</p>
<p><img class="img-responsive" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1025/1035/files/Screen_Shot_2016-05-25_at_3.14.07_PM_large.png?7141699126254284360" alt=""></p>
<p>"I forgot that’s all it takes as a kid, bribe them with some chicken, or a video game, and they’ll do whatever.”</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.4;">Wagner, who played AAU hoops growing up, has done work with Seattle Rotary Boys and Girls Club in the past, having surprised 30-plus members with a shopping spree last holiday season. Saturday's fundraising effort aimed at earning the Seattle Rotary Style 3rd grade basketball team trips to two upcoming AAU national tournaments, one in Anaheim June 17-19 and the other in Las Vegas July 20-24.“They made it to the tournaments but they didn’t have enough money to get out there to make the trip," Wagner said. "So I found that out, found out how much money they were trying to raise, and just tried to do what I could to help.”</span></p>
<p>Wagner said the 'Battle of the Best in the Pacific Northwest' ultimately fell short of its fundraising goal, but much to the delight of the young - and hungry - athletes on site, the Seahawks linebacker had a surprise up his sleeve. </p>
<p>“They had a set number in mind that they wanted to reach and they didn’t know this at the point, but whether they reached that goal or didn’t I was going to cover the rest," Wagner said. "So they didn’t quite get the whole amount and I’m covering the rest. ... I told them after the game. They were excited. They didn’t think I was serious.</p>
<p>"But like I said, they were excited about that, but still were like, ‘So, we still get the chicken, right?’ So I could have offered them a trillion dollars, but they’re still more excited about the chicken. So I’ve got to make sure they get their Chick-Fil-A.”</p>

    <title>Seattle Seahawks’ Bobby Wagner Gets Pumped for Big Games With Kendrick Lamar and the TDE Crew – Exclusive</title>

      <![CDATA[<p><img class="img-responsive" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1025/1035/files/Untitled-1_42bf7ff7-407b-4bc4-a170-c11cd7957dc6_large.jpg?9151258802455054059" alt=""></p>
<p>The Seattle Seahawks are one of the best teams in the NFL with some of the best defensive players in the league. One of their star players is All Pro middle linebacker Bobby Wagner.</p>
<p>After being drafted in round two at pick 47 by Seattle in 2012, Wagner, 25, has anchored his team’s great NFL defense for the past four years. The Utah State alum became a star in 2014, when he and and fellow Seahawks stars, Marshawn Lynch — who kicked off our Run This Town franchise — cornerback Richard Sherman, quarterback Russell Wilson, safeties Earl Thomas and Kam Chancellor lead the team to a dominate 43-8 win over the Denver Broncos. Since his rookie year, Wagner has been named to the Pro Bowl and All Pro teams twice, he’s currently the all-time career leader for tackles in Super Bowls with 22 and has been named one of the captains of the Seahawks. He was rewarded in 2015, when he signed a four-year, $43 million contract extension. This guy is unstoppable.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bobbywagner54.com/collections/all">Get 20% off orders until Sunday!</a></p>
<p>So what gets Bobby Wagner fired up for games? None other than the fellow West Coast collective Top Dawg Entertainment. The football player is a big supporter of Kendrick Lamar, ScHoolboy Q, Jay Rock, Ab-Soul, SZA and Isaiah Rashad. While on the phone with XXL, Wagner explains why the TDE team houses his go-to music, what goes down in the Seahawks’ locker room and why Jay Z is such an important figure in music.</p>
<p>XXL: What do you listen to before games?<br>Bobby Wagner: I really like to listen to a lot of things but the majority is TDE. A lot of Kendrick, a lot of ScHoolboy, a lot of Jay Rock, Ab-Soul, SZA, Isaiah Rashad and a little Drake here and there but I like to listen to them mostly because it gets me going and gets my juices pumpin’ and it gets me excited for the game.</p>
<p>What did you think of untitled unmastered.?<br>I think it’s amazing, honestly. Especially the way it was released. Nobody knew about it, nobody seen it coming and it was just following up a really great album. So to follow up a great album with another great project, it’s pretty dope. Especially, it was put together for the fans, it was put together to show love to the fans that appreciate his music.</p>
<p>What are your favorite TDE projects to come out?<br>I love listening to [ScHoolboy’s] Setbacks, it’s still one of my favorite albums. I like to listen to Kendrick’s good kid, m.A.A.d city and To Pimp a Butterfly. I got a couple of songs from DJs, Control System from Ab-Soul. But I really like listening to the songs when they’re all together as Black Hippy. They had put out a few songs that they’re all on it and it’s kind of fun because it’s like all the people you like on one song.</p>
<p>Who has the best taste in music in the Seahawks’ locker room?<br>Beside myself, I would have to say, Mike B [Michael Bennett] has some good taste. Kam [Chancellor] has some good taste; Richard [Sherman] has some good taste. Richard likes a lot of the oldies that’s why I appreciate him. He likes a lot of the ‘90s.</p>
<p>Describe the music in the locker room at Utah State?<br>It was actually not as bad as people may think. In Utah, people had their set of music that they listen to. A lot of Utah State when I was there, there was a lot of California guys. So, you get a lot of Cali music, you got a lot of dance music, I think the Jerk was popular back then. It was a lot of the music that you can dance to with your teammates. A lot of hip-hop, rap, R&amp;B, it was really fun. It was live in there. Just ‘cause I feel like California people brought a little culture down there.</p>
<p>What did you grow up listening to?<br>I’m a huge fan of Jay Z. I listen to a lot of Nas, a lot of 2Pac. I like to listen to people that make me think. That throw subtle things that make you have to look up what they are talking about because sometime they may put something in there and it may be a one-liner but that one-liner could have a whole story behind it. I just feel like that ‘90s era was pretty special from all aspects. Whether it was hip-hop, R&amp;B, it was a lot of music back then that everyone could relate to and listen to. If you were before or after the ‘90s, a lot of people still go back to that era.</p>
<p>Jay Z is great because he dropped so much game. What’s the best thing you learned from listening to Jay Z’s music?<br>Looking at it holistically, the best advice I probably got was just listening to his story and how he was able to evolve. So whether he was selling drugs, he evolved into a rapper who evolved into a business man/entrepreneur who’s evolving now to trying to help the youth. I think his mission between not letting where you come from and what happened to you growing up affect how you are today, whether you come from the bottom or whatever, if you put your mind to something, you’ll definitely be able to succeed.</p>
<p>That’s the message I got from him listening to his music. A lot of time people doubted Jay Z or didn’t appreciate his music, through all that evolution I don’t see a lot of people saying anything about Jay Z today just because he was able to keep evolving as a person, in my opinion.</p>
<p>Who has the worst taste in music in the Seahawks locker room?<br>I don’t know. I can’t put a worst on nobody with that.</p>
<p>You got the big contract this off-season, what’s a song that sums up you’re feeling when you signed the dotted line?<br>Dang [laughs], I don’t know. It will have to be something uplifting so if I had to say something it I would say Kirk Franklin’s “Gonna Be a Lovely Day” because I kind of knew what was going to happen after I signed it. It was a dope day with me and my family. To be in a position to help my family out and change the trajectory of the Wagner family it’s a pretty dope feeling. I’m not done yet.</p>
<p>What songs best describe your playing style and why?<br>“Break Ya Neck” by Busta Rhymes will be in there because I’m trying to go out there and hit people.</p>
<p>What was the song that was played the most when y’all won the Super Bowl in 2014?<br>Rick Ross’ “Hold Me Back,” that was the theme of that season. Especially on the defensive side, whenever we had a home game and it was pivotal point in the game the DJ will play that song and our defense would start jumpin’ up, dancing and I feel like it was kind of intimidating for the offense because here we are at this pivotal game where a lot of people are sweating, worried and don’t know what the album is going to be. And look at your opponent; the opponent is out there jumpin’ up and having fun.</p>
<p>What are you looking forward to coming out this year.<br>I’m looking forward to 2 Chainz’s new album, I feel like he’s be working hard with that. I’m looking forward to Drake’s new album when it drops. It’s been a lot of good music out lately. Last year too, Meek Mill, Wale, Kendrick, Drake’s surprise project, I think it was a good time for hip-hop last year and I think Kendrick started off this year good.</p>
<p>If you were a rapper in a different life, what would be your rapper name and who would you resemble?</p>
<p>I’ll keep it simple and probably go with B Wag. If I wanted to throw all rappers together I would probably say I want to be a combination of Jay Z, Kendrick, 2Pac and ScHoolboy.</p>

    <title>Seahawks Richard Sherman and Bobby Wagner Visit Emerald City Comicon</title>

<p>Two NFL All-Pros were competing to the best of their abilities, but Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman and linebacker Bobby Wagner were no match for a 12-year-old named Ethan.</p>
<p>On the football field, Sherman and Wagner are two of the best at what they do, but when the two were playing “Call of Duty: Black Ops 3” at Emerald City Comicon Thursday, someone not even half their age stole the show.</p>
<p>Sherman, no slouch himself when it comes to Call of Duty, partnered with Ethan to win the competition against Wagner and his partner. The two Seahawks stars played with fans who had participated in a competition earlier in the day to determine who would team with Wagner and Sherman on stage.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><a href="http://www.bobbywagner54.com/collections/all">Check out my NEW gear!</a></p>
<p>As you might expect, there was plenty of playful banter between teammates-turned-competitors. Sherman noted that “Bobby has been an anchor to his team.” While Wagner responded to concerns about his team’s performance by deadpanning, “We’re just pacing ourselves.”</p>
<p>“Bobby Wagner is a lot of things,” Sherman said. “He’s a talented middle linebacker, he’s a great father, he’s an accomplished pianist, but video games are not something he excels in.”</p>
<p>Even young Ethan got in on the act, noting that he and Sherman weren’t going to give up their lead, saying, “We’re not losing this. It’s not going to be like Super Bowl (XLIX) all over again.”</p>
<p>When asked by the MC of the event if Sherman could have won by himself, Ethan paused before saying, without much confidence in his voice, “possibly.”</p>
<p>Prior to their video game showdown, Wagner and Sherman spent half an hour posing for pictures with fans, many of them creatively dressed, including one man who had a giant helmet, complete with dreadlocks and mask that made him look like a life-sized Richard Sherman bobble head. One young girl in a Sherman jersey struggled to contain her excitement upon meeting the two, saying, “I think I’m going to pass out.” Other fans posed staging a fight scene with lightsabers, while others presented gifts.</p>
<p><img class="img-responsive" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1025/1035/files/Screen_Shot_2016-04-11_at_10.54.57_AM_large.png?12228698293284330844" alt=""></p>
<p>“It is fun to do something different,” Sherman said. “It’s fun to be in a different element and still have a good time with them. The people here are great, it’s a good time.”</p>
<p>Added Wagner: “It’s a more engaging experience. It’s cool to be able to engage with them versus just signing stuff all the time.”</p>
<p>If there was anything disappointing about the day, it’s that Wagner, a huge Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Fan, didn’t show up in costume.</p>
<p>“I’m kind of disappointed in that,” Sherman said. “I’m not sure he’s the fan I thought he was.”</p>

<p>Bobby Wagner was in Vancouver, B.C. recently to help encourage kids to get more physically active as part of the NFL's Play 60 initiative. While there, he took over NFL Canada's Twitter account for an entertaining Q&amp;A with fans of the Seattle Seahawks Pro Bowl linebacker.</p>
<p>"I love coming out here," Wagner said of his time north of the border. "I feel like it's a 12 city and I feel like everybody shows the Seahawks a lot of love. We try to just come down and show that same love back and that same appreciation. Whenever they drive down to Seattle, know that they've got a place to stop and we have mutual respect."</p>

<p>Seattle Seahawks linebacker Bobby Wagner took the stage at last Thursday’s Kirkland Chamber of Commerce meeting, addressing members and dozens of local high school students.<br><br>The meeting was one of two annual events sponsored by Google focusing on leadership, and another in the fall focusing on attracting students to science, technology, engineering and math related fields.<br><br>“We have a lot of personality on our team,” Wagner said. “The way I lead, I lead by example.”<br><br>Wagner fielded questions from attendees for nearly 45 minutes, covering a range of topics from the future of his team to personal inspiration and leadership advice.<br><br>“The important thing about leadership is being able to connect to someone,” he said. “The only way you can do that is to take the time to get to know them.”<br><br>When asked about his personal inspiration Wagner was quick to talk about his late mother.<br><br>Phenia Wagner had multiple strokes and a heart attack but Bobby said she continued to support him through her illnesses.<br><br>“She’s been there throughout my whole life, she never missed a game,” he said. “It inspired me to keep going.”</p>

<p>Phenia Wagner passed away in 2009 shortly after her son finished his first year of college at Utah State University.<br><br>When asked about concerns over his own health in light of a growing national concern over the relationship between head trauma and football, Wagner brushed it off.<br><br>“Me, personally, it doesn’t really change my play,” he said.<br><br>Wagner said he’s never had a concussion and believes in the “law of attraction.”<br><br>“I don’t think about getting hurt,” he said.</p>

<p>Despite signing on with the Seahawks for another four years, Wagner said he’s also thinking beyond.<br><br>“You always gotta prepare for life after football,” he said.<br><br>In particular, he said he’s interested in business.<br><br>On a final note, Wagner gave likely his most pointed business advice, saying even when his team is winning, he’s always pushing forward.<br><br>“I think you’re never satisfied,” he said.</p>

<p>Two Remarkable Seasons For Wagner<br><br>Bobby Wagner is swimming in praises and it is quite justified it seems. The Seahawks middle linebacker is getting the praises after he had two extremely good seasons and in his third year, he is at an elite level. The best compliments came from Richard Sherman, who said, “Hopefully, this year will be the year that Bobby gets his Pro Bowl. Bobby Wagner, Pro Bowl, a lot of tackles,” “We’re going to get Bobby in the game this year.” Wagner has had such a good year that he came even be in the contention for defensive player of the year.</p>

<p>Impact Of Wagner Understood In Match Against Dallas<br><br>The huge impact and difference that the playing of Wagner makes in the team was first understood when he had to sideline himself after tearing the tendon that connects his big toe to the bottom of his foot. Seattle lost that game and it was the only game where Wagner was not leading the team in tackles. Wagner was modesty itself when he said that his contribution was being overestimated though he appreciated the praises given to him. The biggest quality he had is speed and along with that is the ability to gauge what the opponent is about to do.<br><br>Wagner’s Return Sure To Strengthen The Seahawks’<br><br>The return of Wagner has heartened all the p[layers and management of his team. With his return, the Seattle beat Arizona at home 19-3 and limited the Cardinals to 204 total yards. Five days later on Thanksgiving night against San Francisco, Wagner had 10 tackles in the Seahawks’ 19-3 victory. K.J. Wright has now gone back to outside linebacker and Kam Chancellor and Byron Maxwell have also returned to the team.</p>

<p>CHARLESTON, S.C. -- Seven-year-old South Carolina resident Ade is feeling support from Seattle Seahawks players and 12s everywhere after getting picked on by classmates for wearing his favorite hat.<br><br>"Everyday he wears his new Seahawks hat to school, and everyday when he comes home he tells me how many kids have boo'd him," Ade's mom Heather wrote Thursday on Facebook. "I told him I would post this picture on Facebook, and invite other Seahawks fans to like it to show him that he's not alone. He told me it would be awesome if 10 people liked this picture."<br><br>Heather's post when viral, and with at least 140,000 "likes" plus 13,000 shares, it caught the attention of the Seattle Seahawks team and 12s around the world.<br><br>"Ade chose the Seahawks to be his team," Heather said. "He wouldn't even know what it would be like to pass someone else wearing a Seahawks hat."<br><br>The hat is Ade's first Seahawks item, and was given to him by Washington family members for Christmas. Heather grew up in Kennewick, and remembers cheering on the team at the King Dome alongside die hard Seahawks family members.<br><br>Heather has been encouraging Ade to remain positive, and continue to support the Seahawks despite naysayers at school. "He is getting braver, and yesterday he told a kid 'I don't care if you like them or not. I do.'," she said.<br><br>Defensive tackle Jordan Hill talked to Ade through Facetime, and linebacker Bobby Wagner posted a video message for Ade. Head coach Pete Carroll's assistant even reached out, and will be sending a Seahawks gift basket full of swag.</p>
<p>"It's a testament of how loyal and supportive Seahawks fans are," Heather said. "Thank you from the bottom of my heart. I'm so tearful over the incredible amount of support shown," she wrote on Facebook.<br><br>Recently, Ade's Seahawks-loving grandfather passed away, and the support comes at a time when Ade's family needs it the most.<br><br>"We call it The Great Distraction," Heather said.<br><br>The family will be flying to Washington for the funeral this week, but are staying in South Carolina through Sunday to cheer on the Hawks from home.<br><br>"He's never been to an NFL game," Heather said. "But it would be so cool for him to just get high-fives and have people cheering with him."<br><br>The Seahawks face the Panthers on Sunday in Charlotte, North Carolina. Kick off is set for 10:05 a.m. PST at Bank of America Stadium.<br><br></p>

<p>Since his mother’s death in 2009, the Seahawks linebacker has won a Super Bowl, made two Pro Bowls and signed a lucrative contract. But he has navigated these thrills knowing his mom wasn’t there to share them.</p>
<p>Bobby Wagner loves the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. He loves them so much that he owns a green turtle-shell backpack, which he carries on fancy team planes and in rugged locker rooms.<br><br>He loves the ninja turtles so much that when someone broke into his car in December 2014 and stole his belongings, he had only one request for the perpetrators. “All I want is the backpack,” he tweeted. He eventually got it back.</p>

<p>Wagner, the Seahawks’ starting middle linebacker and one of the best players at his position, is a self-diagnosed big kid. But that is not the reason for his obsession.</p>
<p>When he was younger, his mom always put the ninja turtles on TV. On his birthday, she gave him ninja-turtle gifts. So when Phenia Wagner died after a heart attack following Bobby’s freshman year of college in 2009, he didn’t want to surrender something they shared.<br><br>That’s why he has the backpack.<br><br>In the years since her death, he has won a Super Bowl, made two Pro Bowls and signed a lucrative contract. But he has navigated these thrills knowing his mom wasn’t there to share them. He has tried to reconcile his greatest loss with his desire to preserve his mom’s spirit, and that has not been easy.<br><br><br>He looks at a TV when he talks about her. Utah State, the college she pushed him to attend, is playing its bowl game at the moment. But he isn’t really watching. He just needs a distraction.<br><br>“If I looked at you, I don’t know … ” he said. “Part of having her live on and live through me is talking about it. I have to open up about it eventually.”</p>
<p>He keeps her close in subtler ways. Before every game, he runs to the far end zone and kneels. Then he prays and asks his mother to be with him. On July 7, her birthday, he tries to eat a scoop of butter pecan ice cream.<br><br>“And I hate butter pecan ice cream,” he said, smiling. “It’s so nasty. But I’ll have a scoop on her birthday, because she liked to eat it.”<br><br>There’s also the car. When he’s home in Ontario, Calif., he drives a 2008 Lexus, which he keeps in pristine condition. It’s his prized possession, and he plans to keep it forever.<br><br>She gave it to him during his freshman year at Utah State, after she had a stroke and lost most of her ability to talk or get around. Bobby and his sister shared a car at the time, but his parents had promised him his own car if he earned a scholarship. He was talking with his dad when his mom wanted the phone from her hospital bed.<br><br>“So she gets on the phone, and I just heard it in her voice,” Bobby said. “I don’t know how I figured it out, but she basically said, ‘Give him my car.’ ”<br><br>For 14 years she hauled her four kids around in a minivan. But then they grew up, and she traded in the van for the car of her dreams. No one could eat in her Lexus, and she kept it spotless.<br><br>That’s the car she gave Bobby.</p>
<p>The path to a scholarship</p>
<p>In the beginning she didn’t want Bobby playing football. She worried he would get hurt. He went out for the freshman team in high school and broke his arm in the first few weeks.<br><br>He always loved basketball but became a better football player. His mom went to all of his games, and it was obvious she was there.<br><br>“I felt like she had a way of waiting until the quietest moment to say something super loud,” he said, laughing.<br><br>In high school, he didn’t want to ask his parents for money. He got a job with the city but struggled to juggle everything. His mom told him to quit, that she would take care of him, and some day he promised to do the same for her.<br><br>By his senior year, he had only one scholarship offer. He visited that school, Utah State, and saw the snow and felt the cold. He thought he’d rather stay in California. His mom thought otherwise.</p>
<p>"She told me I couldn’t come back to California unless I signed that piece of paper,” he said. “I ended up signing that piece of paper.”<br><br>But just before winter finals, during his freshman year at Utah State, his phone rang. His mom had suffered a stroke. He overdrafted his checking account to pay for his flight home.<br><br>He walked into the hospital room and saw all the tubes and wires. She couldn’t really speak. It was like she was starting life over.<br><br>When she got out of the hospital she was weak, so Bobby carried her up and down the stairs. When she fell asleep on the couch, Bobby slept on the floor, so close that he was almost underneath her.<br><br>“There was nothing he wouldn’t do for her,” said Bobby’s older sister, Nakima Ward.<br><br>‘Instant loneliness’<br>Bobby returned to Utah State for his second semester. He considered transferring closer to home, but his mom told him to stay. She wasn’t very verbal then, but she was a prolific texter, and they communicated every day. He would pick up his phone after practice to streams of messages.<br><br>“We didn’t need to talk for me to understand what she was thinking or how she was feeling,” Bobby said. “It’s almost like we had similar brains.”<br><br>Then one day over the summer, he had a weird feeling in the morning. He looked at his mom and told her he was going to work out. He asked if she needed anything, if she wanted him to stay. He always could do push-ups in his room. She told him to go.</p>
<p>When he got back, she wasn’t there. His dad had taken her to the hospital. That wasn’t unusual. His family had just taken her a few days earlier. His dad told him not to come.<br><br>A friend suggested a movie, a distraction. They saw “Night at the Museum” with Ben Stiller, but Bobby’s phone kept vibrating. It was his family, telling him to head to the hospital. He drove in silence, and only when he got there did he learn that his mom had died. She was 47.<br><br>“It was like an instant loneliness,” his older sister said. “You could see it on his face. It was almost like he had an out-of-body experience right then and there.”<br><br>He remembers everything about that day, May 27, 2009. Who he was with, where he was, what he was doing. He warns people every year that he might be in a bad mood or avoid his phone on that day.<br><br>To this day he has never finished that movie. “And I don’t ever intend to,” he said.<br><br>Moving forward, but missing Mom<br>He wanted to quit football. It felt so insignificant, and his heart felt so heavy. His family had just discussed getting his mom a chair that would help her communicate, and Bobby had added it to his goals. He wanted to buy it for her.<br><br>“I felt like football wasn’t in me anymore,” he says.<br><br>Eventually he thought about his mom and what she would have wanted. He knew the answer.<br><br>He would pick up his phone after practices and miss having so many texts. He would call his home and hear his mom’s voice on the answering machine. When he lifted heavy weights in reps of three, he spelled M-O-M instead of counting. If he couldn’t do all three, he felt he had let her down.<br><br>“He just wanted to train and go to school and play football,” said Kevin Clune, Bobby’s position coach at Utah State. “Everything just became a clearer picture for him.”<br><br>Not long after his mom’s death, everything changed again when his daughter was born. Already, she reminds him of his mom.<br><br>“That was such a crucial time in my life,” he said. “I lost somebody, but I also gained somebody.”<br><br>‘You’re thinking just like your mom’<br><br>He thought he should have been a first-round draft pick in 2012, telling friends he didn’t want to be considered a steal. The Seahawks drafted him in the second round, and his friends and family wore shirts with a beautiful picture of his mom on the front.<br><br>He has experienced special moments that she would have loved. The contract extension this offseason, the Pro Bowls, raising the Super Bowl trophy in New York two years ago. He asks himself all the time what his mom would do, and the answers comfort him.<br><br>“I feel like her personality lives through me,” he said. “How she was and how she acted lives through me. I smile when people say, ‘Your mom used to do that; you’re thinking just like your mom.’ ”<br><br>It is hard for him to talk about this because there are some wounds that are just too raw to ever truly touch. But he wants to, because this is important to him. He has chosen to take the best of his mom, the things that he loved, and share them in his own small way.<br><br>Almost every day during the season, he walks through the locker room, passing reporters standing awkwardly, and smiles. It is such a small gesture, but it is not an empty one.<br><br>“Life is too short,” he finally explained. “That’s how my mom was. She did that. She went out of her way to say hi to people or to speak to people. She was a people person.<br><br>“I can’t say I’m a people person to that extent. But I feel like I’m at a point in my life where y’all have a job to do, and I have days where I’m like, ‘Man, I don’t feel like being here.’ But she would always say, ‘Make somebody smile today. Smile at somebody today.’ ”</p>

    <title>Seattle Seahawks Linebacker Bobby Wagner Presents Gatorade National Football Player of the Year Award To Lake Stevens Quarterback Jacob Eason</title>

<p>Lake Stevens senior quarterback Jacob Eason was named the 2015-16 Gatorade National Football Player of the Year early Tuesday morning and Seattle Seahawks linebacker Bobby Wagner was on hand to surprise him with the award.</p>
<p>"Briefly meeting him he seems like a very great kid, has his head on his shoulders," said Wagner. "I’m definitely going to keep in contact with him and see where he goes. Hopefully, I’m still in the League when he makes it here, and I’m able to hit him."</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><a href="http://www.bobbywagner54.com/collections/all">Grab my gear here!</a></p>
<p>Eason completed 235-of-338 passes for 3,587 yards, 43 touchdowns, and six interceptions this season, leading the Vikings to the state 4A semifinals, where they fell to Skyline, 37-34. Ranked as the nation's No. 16 recruit in the ESPN 300, Eason recommitted to the University of Georgia at Tuesday's ceremony. The Gatorade National Football Player of the Year award also recognizes academic and off-the-field achievements, and Eason has maintained a 3.83 GPA while volunteering his time locally as a youth football coach and with the Never Give Up Foundation helping children fight cancer. He is the second player from the state of Washington to win the award after former University of Washington Huskies and Seahawks quarterback Brock Huard was honored back in 1995.</p>
<p>"Having my name on that trophy with all those crazy-great athletes - LeBron James, Derek Jeter, all those guys - I can’t really put into words how it makes me feel," said Eason. "It’s another step in the right direction. Just to be able to recognized for more than my athletic achievement, it’s a really humbling experience and I can’t wait to see where it goes."</p>

    <title>Seahawks Underrated Linebackers are “Playing Extremely Well”</title>
    <author>

      <![CDATA[<p><img class="img-responsive" src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1025/1035/files/rm4_6528_large.jpg?17127749946259380668" alt=""></p>
<p>Seahawks linebackers coach Michael Barrow has an acronym that describes what he’s looking for from his players.</p>
<p>“I use the term, let’s EAT,” Barrow said. “The E is for great effort, the A is for being aggressive and attacking downhill, and the T is for being mentally and physically tough.”<br>And when Barrow studies tape of the position group he took over this offseason, he sees Bobby Wagner, Brice Irvin and K.J. Wright EATing on a regular basis.</p>
<p>“When I measure those three things, man, I’m very happy with the way they’re playing,” said Barrow, who joined Pete Carroll’s coaching staff after Ken Norton Jr. took the defensive coordinator job in Oakland. “I think they’re playing extremely well. As a coach there are always things we can fix, but when it comes to the things that I’m demanding, that we’re demanding as a staff, they’re giving it all they’ve got.”</p>
<p>Wagner, Wright and Irvin have all been important players for the league’s best defense over the past few seasons, but with so much attention focused on the star-studded “Legion of Boom” secondary, the rest of Seattle’s defense sometimes gets overlooked. That began to change last year when Wagner was named first-team All-Pro and selected to his first Pro Bowl, but Seattle’s linebackers still feel like they are overrated as a group, especially considering how much the entire position group contributes when you factor in special teams play—backup linebackers Brock Coyle, Kevin Pierre-Louis and Mike Morgan are all core special teams players.</p>
<p>“We feel like if we play good, then the team plays good,” Irvin said. “We feel like we play a big part in how the team does, but we also feel like we’re underrated. As a whole, we feel like we’re underrated and we try to go out there each and every week and prove we’re one of the best linebacking corps in the league.”</p>
<p>While the Seahawks linebackers, other than Wagner, don’t have the accolades to back Irvin’s statement, at least some outside observers agree that the Seahawks linebackers are among the league’s best. ProFootballFocus.com, a football analytics website that has become increasingly mainstream in recent years, currently ranks K.J. Wright as the third-best 4-3 outside linebacker in the NFL, and has him as one of only six outside linebackers yet to miss a tackle this season. That same site has Irvin tied for sixth best among 4-3 outside ’backers. Both rank favorably in both run defense and pass coverage, a sign of good overall play. Of linebackers who have played at least 60 percent of their team’s snaps, Wright and Irvin, who has one missed tackle, rank first and second in tackle efficiency.</p>
<p>“Outstanding,” defensive coordinator Kris Richard said of his team’s linebackers. “These guys have played together for a while now. So they understand our defense, they understand where each other need to be, and ultimately it just comes down to communication, formation recognition, and ultimate execution.”<br><br>For Irvin, linebacker is a relatively new position having gone from defensive end to strongside linebacker prior to the 2013 season. Irvin plays that position when the Seahawks are in their base defense, then when they go to their nickel defense with only Wagner and Wright at linebacker, Irvin goes back to being a pass rusher. A situational pass rusher as a rookie, Irvin rarely comes off the field now, and he routinely shows up making big plays from both positions.<br>Irvin initially struggled with the move—sacking quarterbacks will always be his first love—but more than ever he seems to be embracing his dual role.</p>
<p>“I’m both, man,” Irvin said. “The linebacker part has really slowed down for me, I recognize stuff a lot quicker—pass concepts, formations and stuff. That part of the game has really slowed down for me. Then on third down I turn into a D-end, and that’s when my pass-rush instincts kick in. I think I’m a versatile player.”</p>
<p>And speaking of versatile players, it was Wright’s versatility that helped make Irvin’s position switch possible. Wright was Seattle’s starting strongside linebacker in 2011 and 2012, at least when he wasn’t filling in at middle linebacker, but because Wright can play every linebacker position, it gave the Seahawks the flexibility to get a playmaker like Irvin on the field.<br>That versatility could be called upon again Sunday if Wagner is unable to play because of a strained pectoral muscle. If Wagner, who is listed as questionable, can’t play, Wright is expected to start at middle linebacker with Pierre-Louis playing at the weakside spot.<br>“He’s very smart,” Irvin said. “You’ve got to be very smart to play all three positions. K.J. is one of the most intelligent players I’ve been around. He dissects plays before they happen. He has a great IQ, so I try to pick his brain and learn as much as I can. He sees a lot and he’s a great player, it’s fun to play with him.”</p>
<p>Adds Wagner, “He’s just really smart. I think he’s one of the smartest guys on our defense. He’s so valuable because he knows practically every position. He’s a huge asset to this defense.”<br>And it’s not just Wright’s versatility that makes him valuable. If last season was Wagner’s year to start earning honors for his strong play, this could be the year Wright, who his teammates believe already plays at a Pro-Bowl level, will actually be recognized for playing at that level.<br>“He’s playing amazing,” Wagner said. “He’s out there flying around, making plays, reading stuff. He’s the screen master. He’s playing great right now.”</p>
<p>Wright, who is second on the team to Wagner with 33 tackles, seems to have a special knack for sniffing out a play and making a big play in the backfield, hence Wagner calling him “the screen master.” That ability to know what’s coming before it happens has helped Wright earn another new nickname.</p>
<p>“We call him Spider Man,” Barrow said. “I’ll say to him, ‘you’re spider senses are tingling.’ It’s a credit to him and not just him but all the guys and their preparation. He’s mentally prepared, he sees stuff on film and he’s like a sponge.”</p>
<p>Playing well is nothing new for Seattle’s linebackers—Barrow went out of his way to praise Norton for the work ethic of the group he inherited—but if Wright, Wagner and Irvin all keep playing at a high level, this could be the season that more accolades start piling up for a group that has been playing in the shadow if Seattle’s talented secondary.</p>
<p>“I just want them to eat,” Barrow said. “I just want them to line up and play fast. When you play fast and don’t think—the way to defeat a great athlete is to make him overthink, and if you’re out there overthinking you’re not reacting and taking advantage of your God-given ability, and that’s the last thing I want these guys to do is be out there overthinking. I’m happy. As a coach you always get what you emphasize, and what we’re emphasizing we’re seeing on film.”</p>

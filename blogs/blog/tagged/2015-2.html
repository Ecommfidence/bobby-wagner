<p>We played a great game last night. As a defense we were trusting each other and everyone did their job. We were able to get a lot of stops and get some hits. We played well tonight, we still have stuff to fix, but I can see the improvement, and our defense is starting to be that group that everybody fears again. And it was great to get back out there after sitting out last week. It's tough sitting out and not being able help your team, so I’m glad to be back and giving it my all on that field.</p>
<p>Next week we play Dallas and it is time to get ready for them. We will look over film from this last game and fix our mistakes. Then the total focus is on the Cowboys and getting another win. So we will do what we always do, practice hard and smart to get ready for the game. We will be prepared and ready to go.</p>]]>

<p>I follow all the other sports in Seattle, both the Mariners and Sounders. I like both teams I was able to throw out the ceremonial first pitch at a Mariner game back in May and that was very special moment for me. And for the sounders I think it’s incredible what they are doing, being in the semifinals on the CONCACAF Champions League. So that’s a big deal in Seattle right now, and I’m proud of those guys. I love to see this city do well in all sports. The city is on a different level when we are all winning, and us as a football team feed off the city’s energy. It’s just a good time to be a Seattle fan in all sports; I love this city and the fans</p>]]>

<p>Utah State is playing well this season I think we are on top of the Mountain West right now. Just coming off a big win over Boise State, which was a great win! So yeah we are looking really good this year. I think we should win the Mountain West this year and that big for the Utah State. We are a winning program now, and expect to win so its great to have been a part of that and now even better to be a fan of that. Aggie football all day everyday, and there is no better college to play at than Utah State.</p>]]>

<p>This year in the draft I think we did a great job, not only with the pick but the trade that we made that give us Jimmy Graham. He’s a first round pick in himself and it was a great pick up for us and another weapon for Russell to work with. Frank Clark will fit right in on our defensive we always need pass rushers. Tyler Lockett was explosive in college and will be in on this level too and will add a different element on our special teams. So I’m excited to see how all this talent that we have fit together and I just hope it leads to another Super Bowl appearance.</p>]]>
